Provisioning
In Vagrant’s terminology, the process of automatic installation and configuration of software within the guest OS during $ vagrant up is called provisioning and the tools to perform this operation are called provisioners.

Vagrant has built-in support for many popular configuration management tools:
Shell scripts
Puppet
Ansible
Chef
By default, provisioning is executed only during the first run of $ vagrant up
